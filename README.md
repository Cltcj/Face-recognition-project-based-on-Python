#1. SVD algorithm
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a method of matrix Decomposition in linear algebra.
A(m,n)=U(m,m) S (m,n)V(n,n).T
# U is a square matrix of m by m, and the vectors that make up the matrix are orthogonal. It is called the left singular vector.S is an m by n vector, and its characteristic is that all the elements except the diagonal are 0.
# V is an n*n square matrix whose transpose (.t) is also a square matrix, and this matrix is orthogonal, which is called the right singular vector
# s is a diagonal matrix. The diagonal elements are in rows from the largest to the smallest. The first element is larger, and many of the following elements are close to 0.These diagonal elements are the singular values.
